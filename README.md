When a new event that arrives, has the same value for the unique key parameter as an existing event, the existing event expires, and it is replaced by the later event.</p></div>
* <a target="_blank" href="https://wso2-extensions.github.io/siddhi-execution-unique/api/4.0.7/#externaltimebatch-window">externalTimeBatch</a> *(<a target="_blank" href="https://wso2.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-4.0/#windows">Window</a>)*<br><div style="padding-left: 1em;"><p>This is a batch (tumbling) time window that is determined based on external time (i.e., time stamps specified via an attribute in the events). It holds the latest unique events that arrived during the last window time period. The unique events are determined based on the value for a specified unique key parameter. When a new event arrives within the time window with a value for the unique key parameter that is the same as that of an existing event in the window, the existing event expires and it is replaced by the later event.</p></div>
* <a target="_blank" href="https://wso2-extensions.github.io/siddhi-execution-unique/api/4.0.7/#firstlengthbatch-window">firstLengthBatch</a> *(<a target="_blank" href="https://wso2.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-4.0/#windows">Window</a>)*<br><div style="padding-left: 1em;"><p>This is a batch (tumbling) window that holds a specific number of unique events (depending on which events arrive first). The unique events are selected based on a specific parameter that is considered as the unique key. When a new event arrives with a value for the unique key parameter that matches the same of an existing event in the window, that event is not processed by the window.</p></div>

When a new event arrives with a key which is already in the window, that event is not processed by the window.</p></div>

The unique events are determined based on the value for a specified unique key parameter. The window is updated for every window length (i.e., for the last set of events of the specified number in a tumbling manner). When a new event that arrives within the a window length has the same value for the unique key parameter as an existing event is the window, the previous event is replaced by the new event.</p></div>
